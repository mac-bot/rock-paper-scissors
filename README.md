# rock-paper-scissors
My first of many rounds with javaScript.
The first stage of the game will be coded for use through console.log().
The parameters:

1. 5 rounds of R-P-S against the computer.
2. A running tally to keep track of the score.
3. Functionality to determine the outcome, send an appropriate message, and ask if user wants to play again.

After this initial stage is complete and bug free, the next phase will be creating a user interface.

Wish me luck!
